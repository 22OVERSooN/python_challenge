# python-challenge
week 3 Python assignment

This assignment is very interesting, but it is basically just some repetitive code. The following are my views on the difficulties and solutions in this assignment.

Difficulty: The loop and list functions are required when writing code, which are very difficult parts. At the same time, it took me a lot of time to insert another part of the IF Loop in the IF Loop, and there was no good solution when I searched Google. Later, I found that it was actually very easy to solve.
