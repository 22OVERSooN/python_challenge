# python-challenge
week 3 Python assignment

This assignment is very interesting, but it is basically just some repetitive code. The following are my views on the difficulties and solutions in this assignment.

Difficulty: The loop and list functions are required when writing code, which are very difficult parts. At the same time, it took me a lot of time to insert another part of the IF Loop in the IF Loop, and there was no good solution when I searched Google. Later, I found that it was actually very easy to solve.
At the same time, there are some extra content that need to use Pandas to solve the problem. It was a little bit too much for me to do my homework at that time. However, because I learned the first section of Pandas at that time, it was relatively easy to solve.

Simple part: Because list, dictionary is a very powerful part in Python, so I made a lot of use of this part when writing homework, and tried to use fewer lines.
In class, there was no cover in the final part of a TXT file, so I need to go to Google to find it. Although this part is not difficult, it still takes some time to realize how to successfully wrap a line in a TXT file, because there are some codes on the Internet that are not after Python 3. So you often get it wrong.
